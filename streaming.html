          <p>After working in broadcasting for several years and having been involved in the launch of multiple digital streaming offerings – some successful and some less so – I have seen the digital industry adapt to new viewer habits and
            preferences. As streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO and Hulu are trying to find their feet in the digital transformation and streaming is becoming the preferred way to consume video, users are starting to become more
            critical of their experience as they encounter frustrations. With Apple and Disney+ entering the arena with sleek and user friendly options the battle is about to intesify I was keen to find out what audiences were struggling with and
            how I could go about improving the service. </p>

        <h3 class="center">My Process</h3>
        <div class="para">
          <p>As a newly graduated UX Designer I was keen to explore an area close to my heart and which also seems to be something that touches most people’s lives these days. I worked solo on the project and wanted to follow the design process end
            to end. I was hoping to identify what issues users were struggling with, create an Information architecture and design to address those problems. I gave myself two weeks to complete the project.</p>

        <h3 class="center">The Problem</h3>
        <div class="para">
          <p>With a large range of services and potential user problems in the market I first created a hypothesis to align with my own thinking. I zeroed in on content discovery on the services that the user could trust. “Our users will need an easy
            and quick way to find ‘the right’ content on trusted streaming services to avoid wasting time searching for, and not finding, relevant video.”</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <br>

        <h3 class="center">User Interviews and Findings</h3>
        <div class="para">
          <p>To get a good grasp of what user’s grapple with as they navigate their favourite streaming service I set up a series of interviews with 9 participants covering ages 18-45. The interviews covered general uses and preferences to help
            inform the development of
            my Personas. I then delved into the problems in more detail with more targeted questions about the user interface, trusting the services and discovering content on and off the platforms.</p>
          <p> After collating and analysing the data 5 key findings stood out. They were:
            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>It was clear that the biggest hurdle for users was finding content quickly and that was right for them.</li>
                <li>I found that my hypothesis that user’s need to trust the services were low down on people’s lists. Things such as targeted marketing, personal recommendations, content images determined based on perceived preferences were not an
                  issue but rather appreciated in the journey of discovering new content.</li>
                <li>High on people’s list of frustrations was the ability to personalise the interface to better service content they’d like to watch. Most users were frustrated by platforms pushing ‘their own’ content and getting random
                  recommendations which didn’t apply to them after viewing just one show outside of their normal ‘pattern’.</li>
                <li>Users also felt that ratings were helpful but that the platforms didn’t use them efficiently. Furthermore, users would prefer to not having to rate content themselves in the app as it would be distracting.</li>
                <li>As I had suspected, word of mouth was the number one way in which those interviewed discovered new content. Generally, this consisted of friends giving recommendations, hearing about a show or film from work colleagues or reading
                  about it on social media (Facebook and Twitter). To a lesser extent participants were also influenced by news articles and blogs.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>It was clear that I needed to revise my hypothesis after the learnings gained in the interviews. I wanted to ensure that I had accounted for the highly prioritised ‘word-of-mouth’ aspect as well as allowing for ability to adapt the
              experience to the user's preference.
              “In order to easily find content which is ‘right’ for them, users will need a way to connect with friends and be able to personalise their experience.”</p>

      <h3 class="center">Personas & Brainstorming</h3>
      <div class="para">
        <p>Based on my research I constructed 3 personas which representated different users of streaming platforms. I took them into account along with current market trends and emerging technologies as I brainstormed ways to implement functionality
          to make the users' experience more delightful.</p>

      <h3 class="center">Feature Prioritisation</h3>
      <div class="para">
        <p>In order to move forward, I created a list of the features user's mentioned they'd like to see during the interviews. Although there were several issues which could be enhanced, I concluded that I'd be able to resolve multiple frustrations by focusing
          on two specific feature. They were:</p>
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>Recommendations - How can users recieve suitable and 'endorsed' recommendations?</li>
            <li>Personalisation - The user should be able to personalise their user experience.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <br>

        <h3 class="center">User Flow</h3>
        <div class="para">
          <p>On paper I outlined multiple approaches on how to implement the two features. Drawing up user flows for each I settled on the two least obtrusive ways to allow the users to interact with the service.<p>

        <h3 class="center">Wireframing</h3>
        <div class="para">
          <p>While sketching the low fidelity wireframes it became clear that it is important to keep the layout clean and simple so that it can be implemented and used efficently across platforms. Due to the fact that Netflix having an established interface I decided to move forward to a high fidelity version. Rather than completely reinventing it, I have recreated the interface in AdobeXD. This would allow me to tailor the layout to accommodate for the features necessary. With minor differences on the different platforms I choose to base my design on the desktop interface. A polished interface would also allow me to test the prototype with users who are familiar with the interface.
