          <p>LevelEdge was conceived through multiple phases of the user experience design process - from discovery and ideation through to the various stages of mockup, prototyping and final design. I worked on the project during evenings and
            weekends
            across 6 months while managing a full-time job. LevelEdge allows for an efficient and trustworthy way to find and connect with music industry experts in order to quickly solve production issues.</p>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>Based on my hypothesis I conducted a <i>competitive analysis</i> to find similar services available in the market. I also researched other options such as forums which music producers used to find assistance with problems. It became
              clear
              that there was a lack of trustworthy and easily accessible options in this area. Other issues that I discovered was confusing messaging, dated propositions and convoluted pricing models.
            </p>
            <p>Based on my hypothesis that users will need an efficient, friendly and trustworthy way to find and connect with the right audio expert in order to solve their production problem quickly and accurately, I reached out to a wide range of
              music makers and conducted <i>user interviews</i>. I discovered that users currently generally, although time consuming, use forums to solve problems. Trust in the service and expert credibility was repeatedly highlighted as a priority
              along with face to face communication.</p>

            </picture>
            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>To help empathise with and keep the user at the forefront throughout the development I created 3 <i>personas</i> to represented 3 different potential users. I included background, behaviours, frustrations and goals for each persona.
            </p>
            <p>Based on my personas and analysis I created 3 <i>user flows</i> which highlighted a range of features of LevelEdge; search, messaging and leaving a review. I identified what tasks needed to be performed to achieve each of the tasks.
            </p>
            <p>Based on the user flows I created a <i>sitemap</i> illustrating the structure of LevelEdge. Through peer reviews and card sorting exercises I revised the sitemaps to make it the most logical and clear offering possible.</p>

            <h3>Wireframing & Testing</h3>
            <p>Based on the user flows and sitemaps I drew up a series of <i>low fidelity wireframes</i> for both mobile and desktop. After testing and based on my findings I created a mid-fidelity iteration using Balsamiq. Finally, after further
              testing, I used Sketch to create a high fidelity version of LevelEdge which I used to prototype in InVision</p>
            <p>Through out the wireframing process I conducted <i>tests</i> to fix errors and ensure that each iteration was improved. Some of the issues identified during the testing were: hierarchy of elements, text and icon clarifications,
              feedback on actions. In testing we also observed points of frustration which led to making certain features optional. I also conducted preference testing to find out what landing page would be most logical for the user.

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>Throughout the wireframing process and multiple test the <i>design</i> of LevelEdge was established. I created an interface using a strong colour scheme including gradients and with engaging graphics to convey a friendly and accessible experience.</p>
